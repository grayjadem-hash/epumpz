Mobile-friendly Python app to plan a vacation based on your girlfriend's personality and interests.

## What it does
- Matches destination ideas to personality + interests (like beach days, pasta, photography, and wholesome vibes).
- Suggests where to eat and activities for the selected destination.
- Generates a quick day-by-day itinerary preview.
- Works well as a **mobile web app preview** until you're back on your laptop.

## Run locally
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501`.

## Run from phone (no laptop)
Use a cloud IDE like **GitHub Codespaces** or **Replit**:
1. Import this repo.
2. Run `python app.py`.
3. Open the generated public URL on your phone.

## Notes
- This app uses only Python standard library (no pip install needed).
- You can expand it later with maps, restaurant ratings, and booking APIs.
